# Migration from 10.x.x to 11.x.x

If you're using version `10.x.x`, we recommend fixing all the deprecations before migrating to `11.x.x` for a smoother migration.

## 1. Clipboard

The `super_clipboard` plugin has been removed from `flutter_quill` and `flutter_quill_extensions`.

Remove the following if used:

```diff
- FlutterQuillExtensions.useSuperClipboardPlugin();
```

You can either use our default implementation or continue using `super_clipboard`, if you're unsure, try with **option A** unless you have a reason to use **option B**.

### A. Using the new default implementation

> [!NOTE]
> You only need to remove `super_clipboard` configuration if you're not using [super_clipboard](https://pub.dev/packages/super_clipboard) which was introduced in your app as a transitive dependency.

The [configuration of `super_clipboard`](https://pub.dev/packages/super_clipboard#getting-started) is no longer required.

The following snippet in your `AndroidManifest.xml` **should be removed** otherwise you will be unable to launch the **Android app**:

```xml
<provider
    android:name="com.superlist.super_native_extensions.DataProvider"
    android:authorities="<your-package-name>.SuperClipboardDataProvider"
    android:exported="true"
    android:grantUriPermissions="true" >
</provider>
```

It can be found inside the `<application>` tag if you have [added it](https://pub.dev/packages/super_clipboard#android-support).

See the [`quill_native_bridge` platform configuration](https://pub.dev/packages/quill_native_bridge#-platform-configuration) (optional for copying images on **Android**).

#### Other Optional changes

The `super_clipboard` is no longer a dependency of `flutter_quill_extensions`.

As such it's no longer required to set the `minSdkVersion` to `23` on **Android**. If the main reason you updated
the version was `flutter_quill_extensions` then you can restore the Flutter default now (currently `21`).

- Use the Flutter default `minSdkVersion`:

```kotlin
android {
  defaultConfig {
   minSdk = flutter.minSdkVersion
 }
}
```

- Use the Flutter default `ndkVersion`:

```kotlin
android {
  ndkVersion = flutter.ndkVersion
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> You should only apply this optional change if you're not using
> [`super_clipboard`](https://pub.dev/packages/super_clipboard) or you don't have a reason to change it.

### B. Continue using the `super_clipboard` implementation

Use the new default implementation or if you want to continue using `super_clipboard`, use the package [quill_super_clipboard](https://pub.dev/packages/quill_super_clipboard) (**support might be discontinued in future releases**).

> [!WARNING]
> The support of [quill_super_clipboard](https://pub.dev/packages/quill_super_clipboard) might be discontinued. It's still possible to
> override the default implementation manually.

See [#2229](https://github.com/singerdmx/flutter-quill/issues/2229). 

## 2. Quill Controller

The `QuillController` should now be passed to the `QuillEditor` and `QuillSimpleToolbar` constructor directly instead of the configuration class.

**Before**:

```dart
QuillEditor.basic(
    configurations: QuillEditorConfig(
      controller: _controller,
    ),
  )
```

**After**:

```dart
QuillEditor.basic(
    controller: _controller,
)
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The class `QuillEditorConfigurations` has been renamed to `QuillEditorConfig`. See [renames to configuration classes](#5-renames-to-configuration-classes) section.

See [#2037](https://github.com/singerdmx/flutter-quill/discussions/2037) for discussion. Thanks to [#2078](https://github.com/singerdmx/flutter-quill/pull/2078)

## 3. Removal of the `QuillEditorProvider` and `QuillToolbarProvider` inherited widgets

It's no longer possible to access the `QuillController`, the `QuillEditorConfiugrations`, and `QuillSimpleToolbarConfigurations` using the `BuildContext`.
Instead, you will have to pass them through constructors (revert to the old behavior).

The extension methods on `BuildContext` like `requireQuillEditorConfigurations`, `quillEditorConfigurations`, and `quillEditorElementOptions` have been removed.

See [#2301](https://github.com/singerdmx/flutter-quill/issues/2301).

## 4. Required localization delegate

This project uses the [Flutter Localizations library](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_localizations/flutter_localizations-library.html), requiring `FlutterQuillLocalizations.delegate` to be included in your app widget (e.g., `MaterialApp`, `WidgetsApp`, `CupertinoApp`).

Previously, we used a helper widget (`FlutterQuillLocalizationsWidget`) to manually provide localization delegates, but this approach was inefficient and error-prone, causing unexpected bugs. It has been removed.

To use the `QuillEditor` and `QuillSimpleToolbar` widgets, add the required delegates as shown:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_quill/flutter_quill.dart';
import 'package:flutter_localizations/flutter_localizations.dart';

MaterialApp(
  localizationsDelegates: const [
    // Your other delegates...
    GlobalMaterialLocalizations.delegate,
    GlobalCupertinoLocalizations.delegate,
    GlobalWidgetsLocalizations.delegate,
    FlutterQuillLocalizations.delegate,
  ],
);
```

<p align="center">OR (less code with less control)</p>

```dart
import 'package:flutter_quill/flutter_quill.dart';

MaterialApp(
  localizationsDelegates: FlutterQuillLocalizations.localizationsDelegates,
);
```

The widget `FlutterQuillLocalizationsWidget` has been removed.

The library `package:flutter_quill/translations.dart` has been removed and the replacement is `package:flutter_quill/flutter_quill.dart`

## 5. Renames to configuration classes

- **Renames `QuillEditorConfigurations` to `QuillEditorConfig` and `QuillEditor.configurations` to `QuillEditor.config`.**
- **Renames `QuillRawEditorConfigurations` to `QuillRawEditorConfig` and `QuillRawEditor.configurations` to `QuillRawEditor.config`.**
- **Renames `QuillSimpleToolbarConfigurations` to `QuillSimpleToolbarConfig` and `QuillSimpleToolbar.configurations` to `QuillSimpleToolbar.config`.**
- **Renames `QuillSearchConfigurations` to `QuillSearchConfig` and `QuillEditorConfig.searchConfigurations` to `QuillEditorConfig.searchConfig`.**
- **Renames `QuillControllerConfigurations` to `QuillControllerConfig` and `QuillController.configurations` to `QuillController.config`.** The `configurations` parameter in the `QuillController.basic()` factory constructor was also renamed to `config`.
- **Renames `QuillToolbarImageConfigurations` to `QuillToolbarImageConfig` and `QuillToolbarImageButtonOptions.imageButtonConfigurations` to `QuillToolbarImageButtonOptions.imageButtonConfig`.**

All class names have been updated to replace `Configurations` with `Config`, and the related parameter name has been changed from `configurations` to `config`.

## 6. Refactoring of Embed block interface

The `EmbedBuilder.build()` and `EmbedButtonBuilder` have both been changed.

### The `EmbedBuilder.build()` method

All the properties (except `context`) have been encapsulated into one class `EmbedContext`.

```diff
-  Widget build(
-    BuildContext context,
-    QuillController controller,
-    Embed node,
-    bool readOnly,
-    bool inline,
-    TextStyle textStyle,
-  ) {
-   controller.replaceText();
- }
+  Widget build(
+    BuildContext context,
+    EmbedContext embedContext,
+  ) {
+   embedContext.controller.replaceText();
+ }
```

### The `EmbedButtonBuilder` function

All the properties have been encapsulated into one class `EmbedButtonContext` and the `BuildContext` property has been added.

```diff
- (controller, toolbarIconSize, iconTheme, dialogTheme) =>
-  QuillToolbarImageButton(
-    controller: controller,
-    options: imageButtonOptions,
-  )
+ (context, embedContext) => QuillToolbarImageButton(
+  controller: embedContext.controller,
+  options: imageButtonOptions,
+ ),
```

The `flutter_quill_extensions` have been updated.

> [!TIP]
> For more details, see [custom embed blocks](https://github.com/singerdmx/flutter-quill/blob/master/doc/custom_embed_blocks.md).

## 7. The `flutter_quill_extensions`

- Removes `ImagePickerService` and from `OnRequestPickVideo` and `OnRequestPickImage`.
- Removes `ImageSaverService` and from `ImageOptionsMenu`.
- Removes `QuillSharedExtensionsConfigurations`.
- The return type (`ImageProvider`) of `ImageEmbedBuilderProviderBuilder` has been made `null` so you can return `null` and fallback to our default handling. See [#2317](https://github.com/singerdmx/flutter-quill/pull/2317).
- Does not handle `AssetImage` anymore by default when loading images, instead use `imageProviderBuilder` to override the default handling. See [Image assets support](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_quill_extensions#-image-assets).
- Removes `QuillSharedExtensionsConfigurations.assetsPrefix`. Use `imageProviderBuilder` to support image assets. See [Image assets support](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_quill_extensions#-image-assets).
- Removes YouTube video support. To migrate see [CHANGELOG of 10.8.0](https://github.com/singerdmx/flutter-quill/releases/tag/v10.8.0). See [#2284](https://github.com/singerdmx/flutter-quill/issues/2284).
- Removes the deprecated class `FlutterQuillExtensions`.
- Removes the deprecated and experimental table embed support.
- Avoid exporting `flutter_quill_extensions/utils.dart`.

## Minor changes

- `QuillEditorConfig.readOnly` has been removed and is accessible in `QuillController.readOnly`.
- `QuillController.editorFocusNode` has been removed, and is accessible in `QuillEditor` widget.
- `QuillController.editorConfig` has been removed, and is accessible in `QuillEditor` widget.
- `QuillSimpleToolbar` and related toolbar buttons no longer request focus from the editor after pressing a button (**revert to the old behavior**).
- `QuillEditorBuilderWidget` and `QuillEditorConfig.builder` have been removed as there's no valid use-case and this can be confusing.
- `QuillToolbarLegacySearchDialog` and `QuillToolbarLegacySearchButton` have been removed and replaced with `QuillToolbarSearchDialog` and `QuillToolbarSearchButton` which has been introduced in [9.4.0](https://github.com/singerdmx/flutter-quill/releases/tag/v9.4.0). `QuillSimpleToolbarConfigu.searchButtonType` is removed too.
- The property `dialog BarrierColor` has been removed from all buttons, use the `Dialog Theme` in your `ThemeData` instead to customize it. See [Override a theme](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/design/themes#override-a-theme).
- The deprecated members `QuillRawEditorConfig.enableMarkdownStyleConversion` and `QuillEditorConfig.enableMarkdownStyleConversion` has been removed. See [#2214](https://github.com/singerdmx/flutter-quill/issues/2214).
- Removes `QuillSharedConfigurations.extraConfigurations`. The optional confiugration of `flutter_quill_extensions` should be separated.
- Renames `QuillEditorBulletPoint` to `QuillBulletPoint`, `QuillEditorCheckboxPoint` to `QuillCheckbox`, `QuillEditorNumberPoint` to `QuillNumberPoint`.
- Removes `QuillEditorElementOptions` and `QuillEditorConfig.elementOptions`. To customize the leading, see [#2146](https://github.com/singerdmx/flutter-quill/pull/2146) as an example. The classes related to `QuillEditorElementOptions` such as `QuillEditorCodeBlockElementOptions` has been removed.
- Removes `QuillController.toolbarConfigurations` to not store anything specific to the `QuillSimpleToolbar` in the `QuillController`.
- Removes the base toolbar (`QuillToolbar`) since it's no longer required. Previously it was required due to the provider and localization delegate check. The class `QuillToolbarConfigurations` has been also removed.
- Removes `QuillToolbarBaseButtonOptions.globalIconSize` and `QuillToolbarBaseButtonOptions.globalIconButtonFactor`. Both are deprecated for at  least 10 months.
- Removes `QuillToolbarFontSizeButton.defaultDisplayText` (deprecated for more than 10 months).
- Removes `fontSizesValues` and `fontFamilyValues` from `QuillSimpleToolbarConfig` since those were used only in `QuillToolbarFontSizeButton` and `QuillToolbarFontFamilyButton`. Pass them to `items` (which exists in each button configuration) directly.
- Removes `QuillSimpleToolbarButtonOptions.base` which allows having default configuration for all buttons, it didn't work correctly and involved a lot of manual checks, and is a bad design. Introduced in `8.0.0` and we don't have plans on introducing an alternative.
- Removes the deprecated library `flutter_quill/extensions.dart` since the name was confusing, it's for `flutter_quill_extensions`.
- Removes the deprecated library `flutter_quill/markdown_quill.dart`. Suggested alternatives: [markdown_quill](https://pub.dev/packages/markdown_quill) or [quill_markdown](https://pub.dev/packages/quill_markdown).
- Removes `Document.fromHtml`. Use an alternative such as [flutter_quill_delta_from_html](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_quill_delta_from_html).
- Removes `QuillControllerConfig.editorConfig` (not being used and invalid).
- Remove `QuillSharedConfigurations` (it's no longer used). It was previously used to set the `Local` for both `QuillEditor` and `QuillToolbar` simultaneously.
- Removes the experimental method `QuillController.setContents`.
- Renames `isOnTapOutsideEnabled` from `QuillRawEditorConfig` and `QuillEditorConfig` to `onTapOutsideEnabled`.
